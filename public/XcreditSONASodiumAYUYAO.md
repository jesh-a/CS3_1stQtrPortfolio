# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
## by Jesh Angela T. Ayuyao, Sodium

1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting
> During the SONA 2025, BBM mentioned how he'd develop the government services for the people due to their previous disappointment.
> Along with other varying promises and updates he made, what also caught my interest was his mention of the 20 pesos per kilo rice; to avoid manipulation of the traders. 
> Him calling out the corrupted who abuse the nation's funds interested me, along with mentioning the ways he'll prevent it.

2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)
> I found his point on developing the governmental services for the disappointed Filipinos "weird"; no specific reason why.

3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)
> Hearing the topics, problems addressed, and possible solutions during the SONA has me really reflecting on our standing as a country--a community. We have our  own ideals, perspectives, and expectations for our country; many have suffered, many have faced unjustified cruelty, some have had to deal with the lack of support, and some have faced the effects of corruption from the very people who are meant to 'secure our lives' as citizens of the Philippines. BBM's words helped me realize how variant every individual's situations can get, and how his promises could be sure to help. But is it likely?

 > I have no specific feeling towards the entirety of the SONA 2025, but I really feel for the Filipinos hopefully and finally having the building blocks to support their foundation as an individual and as a communinity. All I can do is hope for the best, and maybe then I'll see the effects of BBM's promises--maybe then we can improve. With everything happening, it's normal for any civilian to get overwhelmed; floods, climate change, and inflation. But maybe then, if  BBM fulfills his promise, helps Filipinos, we'll be in a good standing soon.

4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025? 
> We're not quite there yet, but we'll be reaching our peak as a nation `soon`. :D
