# Reflection - Na06  - Sep. 18, 2025

### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. **If else statements** -- This is a code that runs based on conditions.  If there are more than one conditions, it will run the first one if the condition is true, if not it'll run the next, and so on; only if the condition is rendered true. Else, it will run a certain code.
2. **Declaring variables** -- Variables can be declared with keywords like var, let, and const. Var can be reassigned, let cannot and will show an error if tried, const cannot as it is constant; read-only.
3. **Generating Outputs** -- Outputs can be generated with different commands depending on which way the user would prefer. If through console, the command console.log() can be used, if they'd like to rewrite the whole document, document.write() works, and if it's through an alert box, alert() will do.
4. **Functions** --  There are two kinds of functions, *native and custom*. Native functions are predefined and built into JavaScript, like alert(), prompt(), and confirm(). Custom functions are functions defined by the programmers themselves.
5. **Loops** -- Loops are programs that allows a certain code to run while a specific condition is true. It means it will keep loopping until the condition is true, if there is no achievable condition, there will be an infinite loop.

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Inserting outputs in HTML elements** -- Case-sensitive, displays outputs with HTML element. I don't quite understand how the codes work as the explanations for them are confusing.
2. **Event handlers** -- Detects events that triggers calls with JavaScript. I don't quite get how they're used, though I have tried and experimented with them, I still can't seem to properly get it.
3. **Nested Loops** -- A loop inside another loop. I don't really understand how it's done nor how it really works.
4. 
5. 

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Practicing and experimenting with these blocks of codes or codes in order to adapt and understand each of their purposes in my program.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

> Effective 
1. The graded coding activities -- Great for practice and understantding how different codes and programs work.
2. 
> Not Effective
1. 
2.
